In the finale of Friendship is Magic the villains attempted to turn the pony races against one another but failed.

In My Little Pony: A New Generation, we fast forward a thousand years or so and the pony races are divided.

Dare I ask? Were Queen Chrysalis, Lord Tirek, and Cozy Glow responsible? Did this inadvertently result in them losing their powers? Did the princesses die off without magic?

Here’s my theory: The princesses **turned themselves to stone**. Yes, you heard me. They would have seen what was coming, and when they couldn’t defeat whatever evil caused this, they put faith in future ponies and turned themselves to stone, preserving themselves until the pony races are reunited. I believe we will eventually see our princesses again.
