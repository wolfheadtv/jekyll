I decided to check out [Man Cannot Live On Tea Alone](//www.fimfiction.net/story/371378/man-cannot-live-on-tea-alone) after it was at the top of featured for almost an entire week. Here’s my review of it.

First off I’d like to say this is one of the most well-written, perfectly-structured and amazing fanfiction I’ve ever read. Period. (No wonder it was top trending for that long.)

The lead character Jake is probably one of the few good human characters I’ve seen in an HiE fic. He doesn’t at all feel like a self-insert like a lot of them. His trollish behavior towards others is funny, but he doesn’t purposely insult, and I really like that.

Celestia and Rarity didn’t feel out of character at all.

I also really like the set-up. Jake just happened to be accidentally summoned by one of Celestia’s students, and somehow manages to stay sane. I would’ve freaked out.

Despite how little we got of her, I really liked Sapphire Spirit.

The luncheon was probably my favorite part, as it seemed like something anyone can relate to. I’m not saying everyone’s dealt with nobles, but everyone has been overwhelmed like that before. Hell, I can’t even go to the mall without getting claustrophobic, but this guy was literally bombarded.

Last but definitely not least: Rarity. I *really* liked her representation here. It also seems as if Celestia is intentionally trying to get him involved with the mane 6, as it’s entirely possible Twilight might not be able to send Jake home.

They could befriend him, and he’d get to spend less time dealing with nobles.

Anyway, I really liked this story and hope we get a sequel soon. I’m especially hoping it’ll have multiple chapters.
