I’m kicking off a new series I’m calling *Is It Good?*. In this series, I will be checking out stuff that has a bad reputation and giving my opinion on it.

Each episode has two parts. I post part one first and once I’ve finished I write and post part two.

In part one I start off by stating what I know of the thing in question and explaining why I’ve decided to check it out.

In part two I will post my opinion, a little review and if I believe it is deserving of its reputation.

- - - - - -

For the first episode, I will be reading [The Lost Element by Humanity](//www.fimfiction.net/story/47607/the-lost-element). This is a fanfic I hear about a lot that gets *a ton* of hate thrown at it, and more specifically its author.

### What I know of this story

All I know about The Lost Element is that it’s an HiE (Human in Equestria) story. I think the human also falls in love with Fluttershy.

*As if that wasn’t strange enough…*

### Why does it have such bad rep?

I’ve seen many, *many* comments from various places ripping this fanfic (and its author) a new one. What interests me is how every one of these comments mention how the human and in extension, the author is *Misanthropic*. He hates humanity and makes it seem as if he is the only human in existence that is *good.* He makes it seem as if all of humanity is evil.

- - - - - -

Here we go… When I’ve finished reading “The Lost Element” I will post part two.
