I can’t be the only one with this opinion, but I absolutely *despise* Dwemer ruins. They don’t *fit*. The Elder Scrolls is a medieval fantasy, and steampunk just does not fit in it.

I don’t know what Bethesda were going for, but I just can’t understand why it was ever needed.

That however does not mean I have no interest in the Dwemer themselves. I really *do* like the idea of a race that has suddenly vanished and no one knows what happened. It’s fine for them to be extremely technological but steampunk really breaks the immersion and just doesn’t make any sense.

If The Elder Scrolls were too be in an 1800s style setting, than yes, that would make sense, but in medieval fantasy it is very disappointing.
