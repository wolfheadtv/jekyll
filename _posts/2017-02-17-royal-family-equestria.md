There is a big question I’ve had for a while: where is the royal family of Equestria?

We know for a fact that Celestia and Luna have relatives, as Prince Blueblood is their distant nephew *and* he’s Princess Cadence’s cousin. What this means is that Cadence is related to Celestia and Luna, albeit distant.

Blueblood and Cadence are related to the two sisters, so Celestia and Luna *have* to have closer relatives, even siblings.

I’m not sure how many people have thought of the possibility that Equestria has a royal family beyond the princesses, but it is a very intriguing thought and could potentially be the plot of an episode.

So, what do you think? Could there be a royal family, and if so, would you like an episode about it?

Let me know in the comments below.
