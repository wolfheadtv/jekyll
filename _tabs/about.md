My name is Dennis Abernathy Harrison. I am an aspiring writer, blogger, photographer, videographer, and van-dweller currently applying to the Community College in my hometown of Austin, Texas.\
I talk about stuff on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0FcHe0DMTkIIwQHxBzIxxw), write words on [my blog](https://wolfhead.tv/) and spill thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wolfheadtv).
